# Ticket Listener
Let me tell you, I should have found a better way to buy a bus or train ticket for Tehran to Shahrood or vice versa. I think that part of it has been created.

This service connects to the Alibaba web service, receives the list, and sends me a message if there is a ticket.

Now that I started this project, I have been influenced by Golang programming language for a long time. So, I created this project with this language. And I think it has a good result.

So, [@ftimwt](https://github.com/ftimwt), what else should I do to come? :D
